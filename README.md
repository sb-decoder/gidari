Gidari is a "web-to-storage" tool for querying web APIs and persisting the resulting data onto local storage. A configuration file is used to define how this querying and storing should occur. Once you have a configuration file, you can intiate this transport using the command `gidari --config <configuration.yml>`. See [here](https://youtu.be/NgeOJ50IWhY) for a quick demonstration.

## Installation

### Command Mode

```sh
go install github.com/alpstable/gidari/cmd/gidari@latest
```

### Library 

```sh
go get github.com/alpstable/gidari@latest
```

Gidari is not currently available as a stable API. Library support is a [WIP](https://github.com/alpstable/gidari/milestone/5).

## Usage

Using Gidari in command mode is a two step process:

1. Create a configuraiton file to instruct the binary on how to make the RESful HTTP requests and where to store the data
2. Run `gidari --config your_configuration.yml --verbose`

The `configuration.yml` file is used to define a set of rules for making RESTful HTTP requests and where to store the data. See [here](https://github.com/alpstable/gidari/tree/main/internal/transport/testdata/upsert) for example configurations.

### SQL

TODO

### NoSQL

The NoSQL use case should require no overhead from the user. Just include the connection string in the `connectionString` list of the configuration file. Currently this project only supports [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/go/current/).

## Repository

The `repository` and `proto` packages are the only packages within the application that are public-facing stable API with the purpose of communicating CRUD requests to the storage devices used in the web-to-storage transfers.
